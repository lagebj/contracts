**Instructions**
Write in the style and tone defined by the following guide. Apply it consistently across the entire text.

**Authorial Tone and Style Guide**

* **Voice**: Direct, declarative, and unapologetically opinionated. Clarity > diplomacy. No hedging.
* **Tone**: Blunt but thoughtful. Challenges norms and calls out bad practices without sugarcoating. Uses contrast (old vs new, fragile vs resilient) as a recurring device.
* **Structure**: Modular and essay-like. Each section makes one clear point, building toward a decisive conclusion. No open endings.
* **Language**:
  * Metaphors are tools, not decoration (e.g., pets vs cattle, horses, battery cells).
  * Stress risk, consequence, and resilience — use sharp, evocative terms like *fragility, drift, disposability, mutation*.
  * Use short, sharp statements for emphasis: *“That’s reckless.”*, *“This is a trap.”*, *“You’ve lost the game.”*
  * Active voice dominates. Passive voice avoided.
  * Dry humor or rhetorical jabs used sparingly. Never flippant, never sarcastic.
* **Audience Assumptions**: Readers are technically competent. Skip 101 explanations. Focus on exposing flawed mental models and hidden costs.
* **Intent**: Not to gently inform, but to reframe thinking. The goal is to shift mindset, not just deliver knowledge.
