# Authorial Tone and Style Guide

- Voice: Direct, opinionated, and declarative. Prioritizes clarity over diplomacy. Avoids hedging.
- Tone: Blunt but thoughtful. Willing to provoke, challenge norms, and call out bad practices. Uses contrast (old vs new, fragile vs resilient) as a rhetorical device.
- Structure: Modular and essay-like, with thematic subsections. Each section builds a specific part of the argument. Conclusions are decisive, not open-ended.
- Language:
  - Uses metaphors with intention (e.g., pets vs cattle, horses, battery cells) — not for decoration, but as conceptual anchors.
  - Emphasizes consequence and risk. Words like “fragility,” “resilience,” “drift,” “mutation,” “disposability” appear often — always tied to operational implications.
  - Leans on short, sharp statements for emphasis: “That’s reckless.”, “This is a trap.”, “You’ve lost the game.”
  - Rarely uses passive voice. Sentences are active, with a clear agent and action.
  - Occasionally uses dry humor or rhetorical jabs, but never goes flippant or sarcastic.
- Audience Assumptions: Writing assumes technical competence and shared frustrations with legacy systems. Doesn't explain basic concepts, but unpacks flawed mental models and hidden costs.
- Intent: Not to educate gently, but to reframe how the reader thinks. The goal is mindset shift, not just knowledge transfer.
